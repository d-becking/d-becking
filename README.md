### Hi there,

On this page you will find some public projects on  
- Neural Network Compression
- Quantization- and Explainability-Aware Training

as well as Code to papers / challenges / demos. I'm interested in Neural Codecs, Compression of Neural Data, 
Explainable AI (XAI) and Information Theory.

Beyond my work you might find tools dedicated to my record collection, music and synthesizers.
