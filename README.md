Here, youâ€™ll find public projects focused on:

- Neural Network Compression
- Quantization- and Explainability-Aware Training
- Code linked to papers, challenges, and demos

My main interests lie in Neural Codecs, Neural Data Compression, Explainable AI (XAI), and Information Theory.

Beyond my work, you might discover tools related to my record collection, music organization, and synthesizers.
