### Welcome to my GitHub!
Here, youâ€™ll find some of my projects on:

- ðŸ”¬ **Neural Network Compression (NNC)**  
  Preprocessing (parameter / precision reduction), encoding, decoding, and transmission


- ðŸ”¢ **Quantization- and Explainability-Aware NN Training**  
  Using XAI and information theory within quantization-aware training to build efficient 2-4 bit neural networks


- ðŸ“‘ **Research Papers, Challenges, and Demos**  
  Direct links to code, resources, and contributions 


- ðŸ”œ **Future work**
  - Extensions for transformer-based models
  - Neural codecs and general-purpose compressors with language models

### Research Interests

I've long been fascinated by neurophysiological processes and stimulus processing in the human brain. 
Translating these concepts into artificial neurons and synapses, alongside foundational information theory principles,
forms a research area that continues to inspire me.


### Personal Projects
Beyond my work, you might find tools related to my record collection ðŸ’½, playlist organization ðŸ“», and synthesizers ðŸŽ¹.
